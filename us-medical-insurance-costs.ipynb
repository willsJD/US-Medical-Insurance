    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I will attempt to take a csv file of example US medical insurance cost dataset from Codecademy, then use it to import, organise, sort and analyse the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to separate my entire project into sections as an attempt to create a workflow that I could follow and workthrough.  I separated the workflow into the following steps:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Review the dataset</li>\n",
    "    <li>Decide how I would like to organise and analyse the data</li>\n",
    "    <li>Learn Markdown so I can present the information as such in Jupyter Notebooks</li>\n",
    "    <li>Breakdown the project by section, in Markdown, allowing for the python code to be added later (thus allowing goals to be set)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Start using Python3 fundementals to organise and analyse the data set</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python3 will be used to organise and analyse the dataset in the follwing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Import the csv file into Python3</li>\n",
    "    <li>Separate the columns of the csv file into individual lists</li>\n",
    "    <li>Compile the lists into a dictionaries that can be organised by each category</li>\n",
    "    <li>Start to analyse the data by breaking down the data in to groups and compare it to other factors as to determine what affects the cost of medical insurance</li>\n",
    "    <li>Summarise the results</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",

    "I have thouroughly enjoyed this project and it has helped me understand and practice Python fundementals. I presented my project through skills learnt through the Python fundementals course with Codecademy and used Python documentation and web searches to help futher my knowledge and skills.  In the process I have learnt how to use Markdown and in the Jupyter Notebook environment.\n",
